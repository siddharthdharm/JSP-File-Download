# A Simple File Download Application using Java Server Pages (JSP)

A simple script in Java to download a particular file from the server. The **main advantage** of this over inline script is that this method will not expose your server directory structure while downloading the file (on the URL bar).

Add the **javax.servlet-api-3.1.0.jar** file in the *_WEB-INF/lib/_* folder (for Apache Tomcat Server) before running it.
